Titanic Data Analysis Project
============================

This project involves an exploratory analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status. The analysis identifies survival patterns, demographic trends, and other insights.

This README provides instructions on how to replicate the analysis and understand the project files.

Project Structure
=================
The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**
  - `titanic_raw.xlsx`: The original Titanic dataset in Excel format.
  - `titanic_cleaned.xlsx`: The cleaned and processed dataset used for analysis.
- **output/**
  - `visualizations/`: Contains Excel charts (as `.png` and embedded in Excel files).
  - `summary_report.xlsx`: Consolidated report with insights and summary tables.
- **docs/**
  - `analysis_guide.pdf`: Step-by-step guide explaining the methodology.
- **README.rst**: This file for instructions.

Prerequisites
==============
To work with the dataset and replicate the analysis, you need:
- **Microsoft Excel (2016 or later)** or equivalent spreadsheet software.
- Internet access for referencing resources and guides.

Instructions
============
1. **Download Excel**:
   - If you donâ€™t have Excel, download it via the Microsoft Office official website:  
     https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel
   - Alternatively, use free tools like Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc.

2. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Open `data/titanic_raw.xlsx` in Excel.
   - Explore the raw data, including fields like `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, and more.

3. **Replicate the Cleaning Process**:
   - Refer to `docs/analysis_guide.pdf` for step-by-step instructions on:
     - Handling missing values (e.g., average age imputation).
     - Converting categorical variables (e.g., "Male/Female") into numerical codes.
     - Filtering data (e.g., focusing on passengers from specific classes).

4. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Open `titanic_cleaned.xlsx` to view cleaned data with added formulas and pivot tables.
   - Use the `Charts` tab to examine visualizations, including:
     - Survival rate by gender.
     - Survival rate by passenger class.
     - Age distribution of survivors.

5. **Summary Report**:
   - Explore `output/summary_report.xlsx` for pre-built dashboards, including:
     - Key statistics (e.g., average survival rate, class distribution).
     - Tables and charts summarizing the findings.

Insights
========
1. **Gender Impact**:
   - Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
2. **Class Disparity**:
   - First-class passengers had a greater chance of survival than second- and third-class passengers.
3. **Age Patterns**:
   - Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival probabilities.
